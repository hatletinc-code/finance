🔑 Core Requirements
Authentication & Roles

Two roles: Admin and Team.

Admin can create/manage Team Members.

Both Admin & Team can add transactions, but only Admin approval updates balances.

Auth: simple email/password (JWT sessions).

Database Models

Using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM:

User: id, name, email, password_hash, role (admin/team)

Company: id, name, description

BankAccount: id, account_name, initial_balance, current_balance, created_by (user_id)

Category: id, name, description (global across all companies)

Client: id, name, email, phone, company_name, notes

Transaction:

id, amount, currency (default = INR, option = USD)

conversion_rate (if currency != INR)

converted_inr_amount (always stored in INR)

type (income/expense/transfer)

category_id (global)

client_id (optional)

company_id (required)

from_bank_account_id, to_bank_account_id (for transfers)

user_id (creator)

status (pending/approved/rejected)

description, created_at

Transaction Workflow

Team Member submits → status = pending.

Admin approves/rejects → only approved ones affect balances.

Income → increases bank account balance (in INR).

Expense → decreases bank account balance (in INR).

Transfer → deduct from “From Account” and add to “To Account” after approval.

Multi-currency:

Default: INR.

If USD chosen: enter conversion rate at that time (e.g., 1 USD = 81 INR).

Store both original amount in USD and converted INR amount.

Balances & reports always calculated in INR.
